BlackBerry,"i bought this Bold las december, got it and started using it with the same chip from my old Blackberry. Two weeks ago I decided to register the Bold at the cellphone company and suprise suprise I could not do it because the cellphone serial number is already register under another person's name.... They wouldn't give me detail due to privacy policy. Also the Bold is really slow... I prefer my Samsung 100 times.Compré esta negrita las diciembre, recibí y comencé a usarlo con el mismo chip de mi viejo Blackberry. Hace dos semanas me decidí a registrar el intrépido en la empresa de telefonía celular y sorpresa sorpresa! No pude registrarlo porque el número de serial del teléfono móvil ya está registrado a nombre de otra persona .... No me dieron detalles debido a la política de confidencialidad."
BLU,"Considering that this is not an expensive phone with some ridiculous specs, this phone does everything it says it will do. The material is not the best but it comes with a case that you can use to add some protection just in case the phone is dropped.I think the picture quality is decent considering the price of the phone.Overall, if you are on a budget and looking for a phone capable of all the functions of some of the industry leaders (Galaxy S series), this is definitely a good buy.NOTE: I purchased the Global GSM version to use outside the United states. This version is not made for use in the United States. Based on what I've read, if you use the Global GSM version in the United States, you might experience slow data speeds."
